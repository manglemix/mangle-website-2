    An autobiography of my life from 2021 to 2025
</p>

<p>
    Growing into an adult is strange. While I will admit I had it easier than others my age, I would say I was still unprepared for what it would feel like. As of the time of writing, I freshly made the decision to not move forward with my OPT and leave the US permanently leaving barely 4 days after final exams week to relax. As will become evident, I have come to learn that change bothers me. More specifically, not having a home that I know will be where I sleep, eat, and play games, for a few years makes me anxious. It takes my brain time to acclimate and familiarize myself with the area I live in, so having to move always made me worried. However, it is not like I have never had a place to sleep. I know even if I get deported from the US I get to live in Malaysia. It's the lack of permanence that I had an issue with.

    With the rapidly approaching graduation date I was once again faced with this fear. This was further compounded by the fact that I did not see it coming; Really, I did not. I will explain the mistake later on, but I had assumed I would have a few months of 2026 to enjoy in the US but that was not true. To help me come to terms with my departure, I decided to write out my entire university life since it was obviously a huge part of my life that is now over, and my brain is spinning in circles trying to reason over it all. I have been told I have good memory and recall, and that my life in the US was quite interesting, so I hope that you find some entertainment in this mental exercise I've put upon myself.

    This next fact is not that important, but this is the <a href="https://youtu.be/w9I3GSQpO7M?si=KWjYk0B-wW65RKf-">album</a> that I am listening to as I write, if you wanted to get in the same headspace.

    Moving real fast
</p>

<p>
    I was 17, and the worst of COVID had just barely passed. I was in Subang Jaya, Malaysia, at the time. Fortunately, we are one of the many countries that took COVID seriously and took countermeasures so our death toll was low. At the end of 2020 I finished my IGCSE which marked the end of my 12 year life at Sri Kuala Lumpur; 1 year in Preschool-2, 6 years in Primary school, and 5 years in Secondary school. Looking back, I didn't have the fear I do today of closing such large chapters since I was coming out of it with all my friends. It was a shared feeling, and I was promised by my parents to have at least half a year of relaxation. During the pandemic, I discovered the Godot game engine and I was enraptured by the idea of becoming a video game developer. I wanted all the time I had to explore ideas. On top of this, I was getting back into the swing of rock climbing and signed up for a climbing course at KL Eco City. This shopping mall was only one monorail ride away, and the station was walking distance from my house. It's funny &mdash; I felt like such an adult going to this course all by myself and coming back in the evening to work on my own projects.

    My friends all followed roughly the same path and went to college, which outside of the US usually just means an introductory institution to university. The main classes are math and engineering, and maybe writing? I'm not sure since I never went. If you wanted to study in the UK or Australia, going to college was the usual route as many colleges had programs specifically for that to save you time and ease your transition. I wanted the notoriety of going to the US so that's why I skippd on college.
</p>

<p>
    I enjoyed a few months of freedom and over-sleeping until my mom got me up one day and told me to go find a university to study at. That day we went to the very same college my friends were at and asked around. While they did offer a route to the US, it was to Ivy League schools which I did not want to do. I wanted the easy route. I still have mixed feelings about this decision today which I will discuss more later. Eventually I found myself in an online conference for finding American Institutions to study, but it was just me and one other person with several advisors. We both got a one-on-one session and I was able to describe my needs clearly; I wanted a school that taught Game Design, and I wanted it to be in a place with rock climbing. Instantly, the advisor brought up the University of Utah. They were one of the few schools in the US that had a specific Game Design major and amongst their competitors they seemed to be the best, or at least the most serious. Also, if you are an avid climber you might know that Salt Lake City, Utah, is where the IFSC competitions are commonly held. This was the perfect intersection. The best part? The organization holding the conference had a program with the U of U to accept Malaysian students using their IGCSE results instead of having to take the SATs. All I needed to do was take the IELTs exam which was easy given that I am fluent in English and not my native language Malay.

    I'm not fully certain of the month this happened, but it was definitely way too late to do a Spring intake, and several months to early for the Fall. However, we were right on time to register for Summer classes. The visa takes time though to issue, so it had to be online classes. With the timezone difference, it worked out to be around 6pm classes which I loved given my teenage sleep schedule. I was automatically signed up for 4 General Education classes, and despite my self-confessed memory prowess I struggle greatly to remember what they were. Luckily enough, I can just pull up my transcript, but I won't bore you with describing those classes because they were practically useless.
</p>

<p>
    As the Fall semester approached, my mom and I worked on getting myself a student visa, and a tourist visa for her. The Fall semester starts a few days before my 18th birthday, and we needed time to learn about Salt Lake City. So that is why my mother accompanied me on our first trip to the US. My father was the only person in the family who had ever been to the US, and he went to Ann Arbor for university. Nevertheless, he figured my mother would be more useful.

    The schedule was tight. Less than a year ago, I decided to get braces since one of my teeth were loose (I had terrible teeth). What is usually a 2 year treatment was shortened to something like 8 months. It was painful. Early on, my teeth were at risk of shearing off the braces so a bite stopper was added, so for a few weeks I could only drink soup. We had all heard terrible stories about American healthcare, so we sped up the last few weeks of treatment and got them removed less than a week before flying out. The treatment wasn't even done yet. There is a tiny gap next to my incisors, and I have an overbite. We expedited the retainers and rushed an early birthday at home. My siblings were both overseas. The main thing I remembered from this time was grinning happily at the camera. I had never felt comfortable showing off my teeth. With the braces gone, I licked my teeth over and over again. They lined up so well, and my mouth felt so comfortable. Previously, my lower incisors dug into my gum on top, so those gums never sat flush against my teeth. As I am writing this, I am licking that same place and feeling how smoothly they attach. It's a little detail, but I am very glad I got braces.

    The last few things I needed was a laptop and some clothes for the weather. My mother being the thoughtful one picked out some good clothes for the temperature so I wouldn't have to, and I asked my friends for laptop recommendations. While I like technology, searching for the best deals was always annoying, and I had Damien who always knew the best option anyway. On a call with my friends, I joked about not having a hard drive even though I did &mdash; I don't remember why. A few hours later, my good friend Jun Kit who was on that call showed up at my gate and wished me luck on my journey and actually handed me a hard drive. It was very funny.

    It's a common joke that if you dug through the ground in the US all the way to the other side, you would emerge in China. Given that Malaysia is also in that part of the Earth, it stands to reason that Malaysia would also be about as far from the US as you can be. It took three flights to get the US. I had never travelled for that long, and none of my previous vacations prepared me for that. At that time, I had trouble sleeping, so it was downright impossible to sleep on those flights. I have no memory of this journey, and I exclusively rely on one image that I took of my mom and I after touching down in SFO. I don't remember what flights we took to get there, but my mom surely does. I remember the feeling of exhaustion however. Never before was I that tired. It got to the point that my breaths were heavy. There were also some wildfires going on at the time, and I had to keep my mask on. On the flight into San Francisco, I had hoped to see the classic cityscape from Big Hero 6, but all I saw was orangish-gray dirt and a brown fog blanketing everthing. It looked desolate.
</p>

<p>
    In a Malaysian airport, the signs would have English and Malay text, and if you're lucky some Mandarin. In SFO, I remember many of the signs only having English on them. This was strange, since I knew a lot of people in the US also speak Spanish, but I do not remember any signs having Spanish on them (at the time. I was sleep deprived). In Malaysia, many people knew English, but they would speak with an accent or just poorly. When walking around in Malaysia, you would often hear a mix of languages as people of all cultures mingled. In SFO, all I heard was English spoken the exact way I hear it being spoken on YouTube or in Hollywood. Out of all my Malaysian friends, I have the most American accent. I believe this is because I watched Markiplier when I was young, all the way back in 2013. I wanted to prepare myself to live in the US for a while, so I had to remember that I didn't need to artifically add an accent when I spoke, or to use a diminished vocabulary. I just spoke how I do in my head, but it felt so weird to do it. I tested it out at a tech store, but I hardly remember what I asked. Something about headphones. Although, the cashier didn't ask where I'm from so perhaps I passed.

    The time came to board the last flight, which would take us to SLC. I remember the plane being tiny, with only two seats on either flight. Obviously, this was because its a domestic flight, but as a Malaysian I rarely am on domestic flights. Its been a long while since I've flown to East Malaysia, but I could swear that those planes are bigger. The creases in the wall were caked with dirt and fluff, and the floor was covered in dust. I was separated from my mother and I sat next to a stranger. A few seats in front, I saw a huge dog. I had no idea what was happening. You could bring pets on planes here? I wanted to sleep but those seats were so uncomfortable. After fighting to stay awake I eventually dozed off but felt myself falling onto the stranger's shoulder and drooling. I had never drooled before. With the braces, I just assumed that the braces spread out my lips a little and caused it. At the time, I was wearing retainers which expanded my mouth a little so I blamed that. Now, with or without retainers I drool.
</p>

<p>
    We landed in Salt Lake City later in the day, but I have no recollection of my first emotions upon landing. I believe I felt the dry heat and the searing sun, but it's all a delirious blur. I do remember looking up at the sky in fear. One thing I love about Malaysia are the voluminous clouds. They're gorgeous. In SLC, we're deep in a desert and the sky had no cloud cover. In Malaysia, that's usually a sign of haze, if I'm not wrong, so my brain primitively reeled in fear at the sky. We somehow got a ride to some hotel. My mother worked her magic and organized the whole thing and all I had to do was stay alive. After checking in we finally reached a room with a full sized bed to sleep in. Right as I want to sleep my mother warned me that we needed to correct our sleep so we needed to stay up. However, that is practically impossible, and I fell asleep. Thinking back now, I'm sure my mother was also exhausted, but she still left the room and went to find food. She came back after some unknown duration and brought brussel sprouts. We both shared a taste for vegetables in that family, especially when roasted. In classic American fashion, these sprouts weren't roasted but instead deep fried. I didn't care for the greasiness very much.
</p>

<p>
    After that little nap, it was getting dark but not late enough to sleep. I had to stay awake, so we watched whatever was on TV. That was my first exposure to American advertising. Malaysian ads were so boring in comparison. I don't know if I was just that tired, but the ads I saw were funny and entertaining and I just loved their creativity. After rotting my brain with that for a while, I finally fell asleep properly this time. Despite the tremendous exhaustion, I believe I woke up early. I woke up full of energy however, so I figured I should stay awake. I brought my laptop out to the common area and checked the time in Malaysia. My friends should have still been awake, so I called them. I remember being dressed in just gray sweatpants and a T-Shirt and feeling so cold. From my High School Geography class I remembered that deserts have a high diurnal range so it can be cold at night and scorching in the day.

    That there is about the last of the details I can remember from my first day in SLC. All my memories after that are logically inferred, with a few genuine remembered experiences. I know we moved to our next accomodation which was an AirBnb. It was in a really strange building that I had only ever seen on TV where its a two floor, six apartment building. Each apartment's front door was on the same side, and the walkways were open. Later on I learned that this AirBnb was in the Avenues so I guess you should be able to find the building that matches that description.
